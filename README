NAME
    Video::FourCC::Info - Find information about codecs specified as Four
    Character Code

$Id$

DESCRIPTION
    In order for video players to detect the algorithm required to decode a
    given video file, a four-byte sequence called a Four Character Code is
    written somewhere in the header of the file. This ensures that the
    detected codec format is independent of the file extension, which may be
    incorrect due to human error or for some other reason.

    This is similar to the four-byte "magic number" used by the UNIX file(1)
    command to roughly determine a file format.

    Most applications seem to treat this as a case insensitive code. As a
    result, internally, your given FourCC's will be silently converted to
    uppercase.

COMPATIBILITY
    This module was tested under Perl 5.10.0, using Debian Linux. However,
    because it's Pure Perl and doesn't do anything too obscure, it should be
    compatible with any version of Perl that supports its prerequisite
    modules.

    If you encounter any problems on a different version or architecture,
    please contact the maintainer.
