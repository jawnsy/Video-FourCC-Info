1.005 - XXX - Jonathan Yu <jawnsy@cpan.org>

  + Changed my mail address to jawnsy@cpan.org

1.004 - 29 Aug 2009 - Jonathan Yu <frequency@cpan.org>

  + Prevent codecs.dat from being installed (add to MANIFEST.SKIP)

1.003 - 28 Aug 2009 - Jonathan Yu <frequency@cpan.org>

  + Add DBI and DBD::SQLite to build_requires (this should
    fix the UNKNOWN reports)

1.002 - 23 Aug 2009 - Jonathan Yu <frequency@cpan.org>

  + Remove generated files from the repository
  + Use a simple string version, per David Golden's article:
    http://www.dagolden.com/index.php/369/version-numbers-should-be-boring/
  + No longer use Perl::Critic to test
  + Changed test sequence
  + Remove modules available in core since Perl 5.6 from requires
  + Generate codecs.dat at build time, rather than bundle a binary
    copy -- this should make things a bit more robust

1.1.7 - 25 Jul 2009 - Jonathan Yu <frequency@cpan.org>

  + Removed useless headers, reference the main module
    for license and copyright info
  + Fixed peekvideo name
  + No longer test Perl::Critic during AUTOMATED_TESTING,
    only RELEASE_TESTING. Thanks to Elliot Shank for the
    discussion in a private mail.
  + Changed critic.rc to ignore PodSpelling policy

1.1.6 - 24 Jul 2009 - Jonathan Yu <frequency@cpan.org>

  + Silence Module::CPANTS::Kwalitee notes about what we're
    using (Test::Pod and Test::Pod::Coverage)
  + The last variables using TEST_AUTHOR now use
    RELEASE_TESTING|AUTOMATED_TESTING
  + More cleanup of author tests
  + Overhaul test scripts, remove them from Recommends
    (Alias' journal #5375)
  + Update LICENSE and README to a smaller format. Clarify
    POD. No longer generates a readme using pod2text
  + Require Internet (TEST_INTERNET) to do the signature
    test, since it tries to download the key from a keyserver
  + No longer enforce "one dot only" in filenames. This
    breaks compatibility with OpenVMS.
  + Updated perlcriticrc

1.1.5 - 12 May 2009 - Jonathan Yu <frequency@cpan.org>

  + Used clearer license - PD (fallback on MIT, Artistic-2+,
    GPL-2+)
  + Added the databases' SQL source as source-data.sql
  + Moved bin/peekvideo to an example file because it
    depends on Video::Info which is non-free
  + Removed t/03scripts.t and related requirements
    (Test::Script etc) because peekvideo is no longer
    in bin/

1.1.4 - 30 Apr 2009 - Jonathan Yu <frequency@cpan.org>

  + Dropped TEST_DATA from t/99data.t
  + Made t/03scripts.t still work in case the tests are
    skipped

1.1.3 - 29 Apr 2009 - Jonathan Yu <frequency@cpan.org>

  + Changed t/03scripts.t to only run if Video::Info is
    installed (otherwise compile fails since it's required
    for the peekvideo script)
  + Updated to version 1.20 for DBD::SQLite, since the
    multiple defines error is fixed in that version
    o the hack code was removed
    o This should also improve code coverage

1.1.2 - 29 Apr 2009 - Jonathan Yu <frequency@cpan.org>

  + Updated license & copyright information
  + Fixed bin/peekvideo (using {*FH} calls to print)
  + Removed CHANGES file (which is automatically generated
    now)
  + Changed license to Public Domain
  + Minor doc changes in Video/FourCC/Info.pm
  + Makefile.PL changed to passthrough from traditional
  + Added ignore for debian/ control files and .tmp files
  + Removed interface description from README; you can get
    that from the POD
  + Added Build.bat to MANIFEST.SKIP for Win32 builds...
  + Removed version-specific stuff from the README so I can
    be lazy (it was out-of-date anyway)
  + Added tests (99data.t) to ensure data integrity
  + Forced PerlCritic to ignore that hackish thing I did
    with DBD::SQLite::sqlite_version
  + Removed the check for defined $description; it must
    always be defined per the data constraint check
  + Updated the codecs.dat - fixed typos and stuff.
  + Put braces around {STDERR} filehandle for peekvideo
  + Silenced the complaint about package variables, since
    we are using that hack to prevent a bug from DBD::SQLite
    from causing warnings

1.1.1 - 07 Feb 2009 - Jonathan Yu <frequency@cpan.org>

  + Hopefully fixed some failing tests due to upstream
    DBD::SQLite
  + Updated Build.PL and META.yml accordingly
  + Added recommended dependency Test::Without::Module
  + Fixed error with multiple plans for 02fallback.t
  + Now assumes FourCC's are not case sensitive

1.0 - 17 Jan 2009 - Jonathan Yu <frequency@cpan.org>

  + Initial release
