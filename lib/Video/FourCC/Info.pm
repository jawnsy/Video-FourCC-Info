=head1 NAME

Video::FourCC::Info - Perl module to retrieve information about FourCCs

=head1 VERSION

Version 1.1.5 ($Id$)

=cut

use version; our $VERSION = qv('1.1.5');

=head1 DESCRIPTION

In order for video players to detect the algorithm required to decode a given
video file, a four-byte sequence called a Four Character Code is written
somewhere in the header of the file. This ensures that the detected codec
format is independent of the file extension, which may be incorrect due to
human error or for some other reason.

This is similar to the four-byte "magic number" used by the UNIX file(1)
command to roughly determine a file format.

Most applications seem to treat this as a case insensitive code. As a result,
internally, your given FourCC's will be silently converted to uppercase.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Video::FourCC::Info;

  my $codec = Video::FourCC::Info->new('DIV3');

  printf "Codec description: %s\n", $codec->description;

=head1 COMPATIBILITY

This module was tested under Perl 5.10.0, using Debian Linux. However, because
it's Pure Perl and doesn't do anything too obscure, it should be compatible
with any version of Perl that supports its prerequisite modules.

If you encounter any problems on a different version or architecture, please
contact the maintainer.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 Video::FourCC::Info->new( $fourcc )

Creates a C<Video::FourCC::Info> object, which provides information about
the given Four Character Code. If the code does not exist in the database,
it will return an error.

Example code:

  my $codec = Video::FourCC::Info->new('DIV3');

This method will return an appropriate B<Video::FourCC::Info> object or throw
an exception on error.

=cut

sub new {
  my ($class, $fourcc) = @_;

  Carp::croak('You must call this as a class method') if ref($class);
  Carp::croak('You must specify a FourCC') unless defined($fourcc);

  $fourcc = uc($fourcc);

  my $self = {
    fourcc         => $fourcc,
  };

  my $sth = $dbh->prepare('SELECT * FROM fourcc WHERE fourcc = ?');
  $sth->execute($fourcc);

  my $href = $sth->fetchrow_hashref;
  if (defined $href) {
    $self->{desc}  = $href->{description};

    if (defined $href->{owner}) {
      $self->{owner} = $href->{owner};
    }
    if (defined $href->{registered}) {
      # If we have a DateTime object, we should parse the date and store it
      if (exists $INC{'DateTime.pm'}) {
        # Extract the Y/M/D numbers from $href->{registered}; this should
        # have the format: yyyy-mm-dd
        my ($year, $month, $day) =
          ($href->{registered} =~ m/^(\d{4})-(\d{2})-(\d{2})$/s);

          $self->{regdate} = DateTime->new(
          year    => $year,
          month   => $month,
          day     => $day,
        );
      }
      # Otherwise, we have to store the date as a simple string
      else {
        $self->{regdate} = $href->{registered};
      }
    }
  }
  else {
    Carp::croak('FourCC ' . $fourcc . ' was not found in the database');
  }

  return bless($self, $class);
}

=head2 Video::FourCC::Info->describe( $fourcc )

This is really just a shortcut to grab the short description of a codec given
a Four Character Code as input. Note that this is a class method, not an
object method.

Example code:

  my $codec_desc = Video::FourCC::Info->describe('DIV3');

Internally, this method creates a temporary object and returns the
description, destroying the object due to falling out of scope. If you already
have a C<Video::FourCC::Info> object, then the B<description> accessor will
provide better performance.

Note, that just like C<new>, this class method may throw an exception if the
Four Character Code does not exist in the database.

Remember that this value could be C<undef> if the information is unknown.

=cut

sub describe {
  my ($class, $fourcc) = @_;

  Carp::croak('You must call this as a class method') if ref($class);
  Carp::croak('You must specify a FourCC') unless defined($fourcc);

  my $codec;
  eval {
    $codec = $class->new($fourcc);
  };
  if ($@) {
    Carp::croak($@);
  }
  return $codec->description;
}

=head2 $codec->description( )

This returns the short description of the codec. It may be C<undef> if there
is no description in the database.

Example code:

  my $codec_desc = $codec->description;

Remember that this value could be C<undef> if the information is unknown.

=cut

sub description {
  my ($self) = @_;

  Carp::croak('You must call this method as an object') unless ref($self);

  return $self->{desc};
}

=head2 $codec->registered( )

This returns the short description of the codec. It may be C<undef> if there
is no description in the database.

If C<DateTime> is installed, then this will be a DateTime object. Otherwise,
it will simply be a string in the format C<yyyy-mm-dd>.

Example code:

  my $registered = $codec->registered;

Remember that this value could be C<undef> if the information is unknown.

=cut

sub registered {
  my ($self) = @_;

  Carp::croak('You must call this method as an object') unless ref($self);

  return $self->{regdate};
}

=head2 $codec->owner( )

This returns the name of the corporation or other entity that owns the
FourCC. Generally, this seems to be an ad-hoc standard, so it's a listing
of the first entity known to use the given FourCC.

Example code:

  my $owner_name = $codec->owner;

Remember that this value could be C<undef> if the information is unknown.

=cut

sub owner {
  my ($self) = @_;

  Carp::croak('You must call this method as an object') unless ref($self);

  return $self->{owner};
}

=head2 $codec->code( )

This returns the Four Character Code corresponding to the current
C<Video::FourCC::Info> object.

Example code:

  my $fourcc = $codec->fourcc;

=cut

sub code {
  my ($self) = @_;

  Carp::croak('You must call this method as an object') unless ref($self);

  return $self->{fourcc};
}
